# Default Helix themes
This is a minimal list of default themes that could be included in the binary as they are lightweight. A themes manager will be available in the future. This is a way to reduce friction on the onboarding when there is at least one theme already available.

## Sources
I copy pasted one MIT licensed catpuccin themes in the Helix TOML format by hand.
